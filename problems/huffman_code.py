import queue as Queue
#Huffman coding assigns variable length codewords to fixed length input characters based on their frequencies.
# More frequent characters are assigned shorter codewords and less frequent characters are assigned longer codewords.
# All edges along the path to a character contain a code digit. If they are on the left side of the tree, they will
# be a 0 (zero). If on the right, they'll be a 1 (one). Only the leaves will contain a letter and its frequency count.
# All other nodes will contain a null instead of a character, and the count of the frequency of all of it and its
# descendant characters.

#For instance, consider the string ABRACADABRA. There are a total of  characters in the string. This number should
# match the count in the ultimately determined root of the tree. Our frequencies are  and . The two smallest frequencies
# are for  and , both equal to , so we'll create a tree with them. The root node will contain the sum of the counts of
# its descendants, in this case . The left node will be the first character encountered, , and the right will contain .
# Next we have  items with a character count of : the tree we just created, the character  and the character .
# The tree came first, so it will go on the left of our new root node.  will go on the right. Repeat until the tree
# is complete, then fill in the 's and 's for the edges. The finished graph looks like:

#Input characters are only present in the leaves. Internal nodes have a character value of Ï• (NULL). We can determine
# that our values for characters are:

#A - 0
#B - 111
#C - 1100
#D - 1101
#R - 10
#Our Huffman encoded string is:

# A B    R  A C     A D     A B    R  A
# 0 111 10 0 1100 0 1101 0 111 10 0
# or
